Design Decisions:
1. State Management:

    The app uses the StatefulWidget approach for better state management. This is because the app needs to manage the state of the locationController (the text input for the location).

2. User Interface (UI):

    The UI is kept simple with a TextField for the user to input the location and a button to trigger the weather request.
    The weather details are displayed in a Card to provide a structured and visually appealing presentation.

3. API Request Handling:

    The getWeather function is responsible for making API requests to OpenWeatherMap.
    It constructs the API URL based on the user's input and the API key.
    It uses the http package to make the GET request.

4. API Response Handling:

    Upon a successful API response (status code 200), the app extracts relevant weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.
    These details are then displayed in a Card within an AlertDialog.

5. Error Handling:

    The app checks for common errors such as an empty location input or a failure to fetch weather data.
    If the location is empty, an error dialog is shown to the user.
    If there is an error fetching weather data, another error dialog is displayed.

6. User Experience (UX):

    To enhance UX, the app uses an AlertDialog to present the weather details in a clean and organized manner.
    The app also provides feedback to the user through error dialogs in case of issues.

7. Visual Appeal:

    Icons are used alongside weather details for temperature, humidity, and wind speed to make the information more visually appealing.
    The AlertDialog is designed with a Card to provide a structured and visually pleasing presentation.

Considerations:

    Code Readability:
        The code is structured to be readable and maintainable. It follows Flutter best practices for naming conventions and widget organization.

    Separation of Concerns:
        The API-related logic is encapsulated within the getWeather function, promoting separation of concerns.

    Asynchronous Operations:
        Asynchronous operations (e.g., API requests) are handled using async and await to avoid blocking the UI.

    User Feedback:
        The app provides feedback to the user through error dialogs in case of issues. This helps users understand what went wrong.

    Dynamic Content:
        The app handles dynamic content (user input for location) and provides appropriate error handling for scenarios like an empty location.

These design decisions aim to create a simple, user-friendly weather app with a focus on readability, error handling, and a visually appealing interface.
